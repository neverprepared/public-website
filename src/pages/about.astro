	<p>
		Never Prepared is built on a simple idea: there is never a good time like
		the present to be unprepared. We spend too much time waiting for the right
		moment, the right tools, the right plan. But the truth is, the best time to
		start is now &mdash; ready or not.
	</p>

	<p>
		This site is a home for stories, ideas, and resources for people who embrace
		the unprepared life. Whether it's launching a project, picking up a new skill,
		or just trying something you've never done before &mdash; the only real
		prerequisite is showing up.
